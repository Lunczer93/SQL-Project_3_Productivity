# -SQL-Project_3_Productivity

I INTRODUCTION

I was asked to analyze the survey of the productivity of people from selected countries regarding the productivity of people in the range of Age (22-25, 30-33, 38-44, 55+). 
I am interested in details about the productivity of people and which factors have influence on it to make them motivated in order to undertake their duties.
So, if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also. 

II	ANALYSIS

Respondents were obliged to answer a few questions in the productivity survey. 
The analysis was based on these responses in percentage values.
Next, an in-depth analysis was performed so as to show the percentage quantity of all people, who were involved in this survey.
SQL Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, SQL Server Advanced Functions, String Functions and Variable were used to perform this analysis in Microsoft SQL Server.
The whole steps of my analysis were described in my project.
